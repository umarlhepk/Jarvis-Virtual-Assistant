# Jarvis - Virtual Assistant

Jarvis is a Python-based virtual assistant capable of handling voice commands to perform tasks like opening websites, playing music, fetching news, and interacting with OpenAI for general queries.

## Features
- **Voice Activation**: Activate Jarvis with the wake word "Jarvis."
- **Web Browsing**: Open popular websites like Google, YouTube, and Facebook via voice commands.
- **Music Playback**: Search and play songs from a predefined library.
- **News Updates**: Fetch and read the latest news headlines using NewsAPI.
- **AI Integration**: Responds to general queries using OpenAI's GPT-4.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Uses Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) for audio responses.

## How It Works
- **Speech Recognition**: Uses `speech_recognition` library to convert voice to text.
- **Task Execution**: Maps commands to actions via Python functions.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Generates audio responses dynamically using `gTTS` and plays them with `pygame`.
- **News Fetching**: Retrieves top news headlines using NewsAPI.
